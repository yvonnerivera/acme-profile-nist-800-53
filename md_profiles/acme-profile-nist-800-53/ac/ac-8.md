    # This section contains the parameters that are part of this control.
  # Each parameter has properties. Only the profile-values and display-name properties are editable.
  # The other properties are informational.
  #
  # The values property for a parameter represents values inherited from the OSCAL catalog.
  # To override the catalog settings, use bullets under profile-values as shown below:
  #
  #   profile-values:
  #     - value 1
  #     - value 2
  #
  # If the "- <REPLACE_ME>" placeholder appears under profile-values, it is the same as if
  # the profile-values property were left empty.
  #
  # Some parameters may show an aggregates property which lists other parameters. This means
  # the parameter value is made up of the values from the other parameters. For parameters
  # that aggregate, profile-values is not applicable.
  #
  # Property param-value-origin is meant for putting the origin from where that parameter comes from.
  # In order to be changed in the current profile, profile-param-value-origin property will be displayed with
  # the placeholder "<REPLACE_ME>" for you to be replaced. If a parameter already has a param-value-origin
  # coming from an inherited profile, do no change this value, instead use profile-param-value-origin as follows:
  #
  #    param-value-origin: DO NOT REPLACE - this is the original value
  #    profile-param-value-origin: <REPLACE_ME> - replace the new value required HERE

# ac-8 - \[Access Control\] System Use Notification

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Display {{ insert: param, ac-08_odp.01 }} to users before granting access to the system that provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines and state that:

  - \[1.\] Users are accessing a U.S. Government system;
  - \[2.\] System usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit;
  - \[3.\] Unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and
  - \[4.\] Use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording;

- \[b.\] Retain the notification message or banner on the screen until users acknowledge the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on to or further access the system; and

- \[c.\] For publicly accessible systems:

  - \[1.\] Display system use information {{ insert: param, ac-08_odp.02 }} , before granting further access to the publicly accessible system;
  - \[2.\] Display references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or auditing that are consistent with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities; and
  - \[3.\] Include a description of the authorized uses of the system.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[AC-08a.\] {{ insert: param, ac-08_odp.01 }} is displayed to users before granting access to the system that provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines;

  - \[AC-08a.01\] the system use notification states that users are accessing a U.S. Government system;
  - \[AC-08a.02\] the system use notification states that system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit;
  - \[AC-08a.03\] the system use notification states that unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and
  - \[AC-08a.04\] the system use notification states that use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording;

- \[AC-08b.\] the notification message or banner is retained on the screen until users acknowledge the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on to or further access the system;

- \[AC-08c.\]

  - \[AC-08c.01\] for publicly accessible systems, system use information {{ insert: param, ac-08_odp.02 }} is displayed before granting further access to the publicly accessible system;
  - \[AC-08c.02\] for publicly accessible systems, any references to monitoring, recording, or auditing that are consistent with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities are displayed;
  - \[AC-08c.03\] for publicly accessible systems, a description of the authorized uses of the system is included.

## Control guidance

System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners displayed before individuals log in to systems. System use notifications are used only for access via logon interfaces with human users. Notifications are not required when human interfaces do not exist. Based on an assessment of risk, organizations consider whether or not a secondary system use notification is needed to access applications or other system resources after the initial network logon. Organizations consider system use notification messages or banners displayed in multiple languages based on organizational needs and the demographics of system users. Organizations consult with the privacy office for input regarding privacy messaging and the Office of the General Counsel or organizational equivalent for legal review and approval of warning banner content.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://oscal-compass.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
