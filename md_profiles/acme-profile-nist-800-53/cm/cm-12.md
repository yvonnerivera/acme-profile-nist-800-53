x-trestle-set-params:
    # This section contains the parameters that are part of this control.
  # Each parameter has properties. Only the profile-values and display-name properties are editable.
  # The other properties are informational.
  #
  # The values property for a parameter represents values inherited from the OSCAL catalog.
  # To override the catalog settings, use bullets under profile-values as shown below:
  #
  #   profile-values:
  #     - value 1
  #     - value 2
  #
  # If the "- <REPLACE_ME>" placeholder appears under profile-values, it is the same as if
  # the profile-values property were left empty.
  #
  # Some parameters may show an aggregates property which lists other parameters. This means
  # the parameter value is made up of the values from the other parameters. For parameters
  # that aggregate, profile-values is not applicable.
  #
  # Property param-value-origin is meant for putting the origin from where that parameter comes from.
  # In order to be changed in the current profile, profile-param-value-origin property will be displayed with
  # the placeholder "<REPLACE_ME>" for you to be replaced. If a parameter already has a param-value-origin
  # coming from an inherited profile, do no change this value, instead use profile-param-value-origin as follows:
  #
  #    param-value-origin: DO NOT REPLACE - this is the original value
  #    profile-param-value-origin: <REPLACE_ME> - replace the new value required HERE

# cm-12 - \[Configuration Management\] Information Location

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Identify and document the location of {{ insert: param, cm-12_odp }} and the specific system components on which the information is processed and stored;

- \[b.\] Identify and document the users who have access to the system and system components where the information is processed and stored; and

- \[c.\] Document changes to the location (i.e., system or system components) where the information is processed and stored.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[CM-12a.\]

  - \[CM-12a.[01]\] the location of {{ insert: param, cm-12_odp }} is identified and documented;
  - \[CM-12a.[02]\] the specific system components on which {{ insert: param, cm-12_odp }} is processed are identified and documented;
  - \[CM-12a.[03]\] the specific system components on which {{ insert: param, cm-12_odp }} is stored are identified and documented;

- \[CM-12b.\]

  - \[CM-12b.[01]\] the users who have access to the system and system components where {{ insert: param, cm-12_odp }} is processed are identified and documented;
  - \[CM-12b.[02]\] the users who have access to the system and system components where {{ insert: param, cm-12_odp }} is stored are identified and documented;

- \[CM-12c.\]

  - \[CM-12c.[01]\] changes to the location (i.e., system or system components) where {{ insert: param, cm-12_odp }} is processed are documented;
  - \[CM-12c.[02]\] changes to the location (i.e., system or system components) where {{ insert: param, cm-12_odp }} is stored are documented.

## Control guidance

Information location addresses the need to understand where information is being processed and stored. Information location includes identifying where specific information types and information reside in system components and how information is being processed so that information flow can be understood and adequate protection and policy management provided for such information and system components. The security category of the information is also a factor in determining the controls necessary to protect the information and the system component where the information resides (see [FIPS 199](#628d22a1-6a11-4784-bc59-5cd9497b5445) ). The location of the information and system components is also a factor in the architecture and design of the system (see [SA-4](#sa-4), [SA-8](#sa-8), [SA-17](#sa-17)).

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://oscal-compass.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
