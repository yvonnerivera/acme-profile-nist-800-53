    # This section contains the parameters that are part of this control.
  # Each parameter has properties. Only the profile-values and display-name properties are editable.
  # The other properties are informational.
  #
  # The values property for a parameter represents values inherited from the OSCAL catalog.
  # To override the catalog settings, use bullets under profile-values as shown below:
  #
  #   profile-values:
  #     - value 1
  #     - value 2
  #
  # If the "- <REPLACE_ME>" placeholder appears under profile-values, it is the same as if
  # the profile-values property were left empty.
  #
  # Some parameters may show an aggregates property which lists other parameters. This means
  # the parameter value is made up of the values from the other parameters. For parameters
  # that aggregate, profile-values is not applicable.
  #
  # Property param-value-origin is meant for putting the origin from where that parameter comes from.
  # In order to be changed in the current profile, profile-param-value-origin property will be displayed with
  # the placeholder "<REPLACE_ME>" for you to be replaced. If a parameter already has a param-value-origin
  # coming from an inherited profile, do no change this value, instead use profile-param-value-origin as follows:
  #
  #    param-value-origin: DO NOT REPLACE - this is the original value
  #    profile-param-value-origin: <REPLACE_ME> - replace the new value required HERE

# ia-12.5 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Address Confirmation

## Control Statement

Require that a {{ insert: param, ia-12.05_odp }} be delivered through an out-of-band channel to verify the users address (physical or digital) of record.

## Control Assessment Objective

a {{ insert: param, ia-12.05_odp }} is delivered through an out-of-band channel to verify the userâ€™s address (physical or digital) of record.

## Control guidance

To make it more difficult for adversaries to pose as legitimate users during the identity proofing process, organizations can use out-of-band methods to ensure that the individual associated with an address of record is the same individual that participated in the registration. Confirmation can take the form of a temporary enrollment code or a notice of proofing. The delivery address for these artifacts is obtained from records and not self-asserted by the user. The address can include a physical or digital address. A home address is an example of a physical address. Email addresses and telephone numbers are examples of digital addresses.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://oscal-compass.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
